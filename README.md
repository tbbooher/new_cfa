cfa_redesign
============

Going to start with restempto theme

new site for cfa: www.crossfitadaptation.com

### goals

* site has two audiences: existing and prospective members
* existing members: want to know who the coaches are, what the schedule is, and what the workout of the day is
* prospective members: want to find out what crossfit is and need to be convinced that this gym is for them, as opposed ot the competition
* to look professional, modern, corporate, clean, cutting-edge and expensive
* to fit in a very low budget, but look like site designs that cost 10 to 20x more (the top 5% of crossfit gyms)
* to have high energy (implies clean lines and active content)
* to load quickly and efficiently (responsive across several devices)
* to be very secure (sufficently secure against a targeted attack)

### Questions Site Must Answer

* new member
  * How much does it cost?
  * When do you offer classes?
  * Where are you?
  * What is special/unique about this gym compared to others in the area?
  * What benefits/programs do you offer?
* existing member
  * When are the classes?
  * What is the workout of the day?
* both
  * who are the coaches, what are their backgrounds?
  * where can I find pictures taken at the gym?

### competition

Competition is other CF gyms and to a much lesser degree existing gyms (i.e. Gold's gym) and other bootcamp programs. CrossFit corporate marketing and the program itself will handle the competion with alternatives, this site needs to convince a browser to choose CFA over these alternatives: 

* Trident Crossfit
* Patriot Crossfit
* Potomac Crossfit
* CrossFit Oldtown
* CrossFit South Arlington

#### Potential:
* Ballston CrossFit
* CrossFit Rosslyn

### target market:
* well educated north-virginians with north of $200 a month to spend on fitness
* target area: Arlington, Alexandria, VA
* people who are very technically astute and who find it important to be part of the next trend (like crossfit)
* target market is generally younger and will browse heavily on mobile devices, but also at work with a lot of government workers (implies ie8)

### copy
* keep things the same as they currently are

### concept
* look at other sites, come up with a list we feel is top-class
* look at themes, but keep code clean

> designer feedback: all sites too busy, except centralathlete

### technical decisions

* CMS: Wordpress
* Front-end: HTML5, +css3, js
* Responsive
* Server: Apache on custom server (linode)
* Large server storage space allocated due to desire for posting of daily pics

### current budget does not allow for:
* [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)
* Any copy changes or changes to site structure
* Custom Graphics/Illustration
* Photography
* Marketing (placement on Google plus, sitemaps, etc)
* Protection against [DDoS](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/DDoS_attack.html)
