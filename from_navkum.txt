              <p>
                CrossFit was introduced to me in 2010 and immediately changed my outlook 
                on my fitness and health. The methodology, challenges, and dedication that 
                it promotes allowed me to start out as a beginner, and work towards attainable goals 
                within my abilities.</p> 
                <p>
                Learning specific Olympic lifts or trying to master some other 
                movement, became a great drive for me. Although my athletic career only stemmed from a 
                few years of high school sports, I have never felt this good, fit, or healthy.</p> 
                <p>
                I’m CrossFit L1 certified, CrossFit Kids certified, and have attended various related seminars. I’m always thrilled when new and veteran athletes make meaningful gains or accomplish new goals</p>
